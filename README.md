# html-questionnaire

This project is a single page app built as a University practice case.

The app will consist of Yes or No quizz based on HTML knowledge.

The project is guided by the below requirements :

 - Based on a JSON format "database"
 
 - Built using DOM manipulation techniques
 
 - The user will receive feedbacks as "arguments" if answering wrong & a final score such as "3/5 good answers" upon submission
 
 NB :
 
 - The use of Loop method is strongly suggested for DOM writing & for good answers comparison.
 
 - The use of AJAX technique is also suggested to provide user with "arguments" in case of wrong answer.
